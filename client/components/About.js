    Our Mission
    </h1>
    <p>Project Clear is about raising awareness concerning plastic pollution and boosting those that seek action against. Actions for change, whether it be volunteer cleaning or lobbying for single-use plastic ban. Plastic does have its uses, but its use should be reserved for only the more specialized applications it can have. </p>
