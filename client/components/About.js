      Hello, my name is James Carmody, and I'm a Web Developer/Software Engineer born, raised, and residing in Queens, New York. Before working in this field, I got a degree in chemistry and was working in an environmental lab. There isn't a day in nature I haven't enjoyed, and I want to keep it that way.</p>
